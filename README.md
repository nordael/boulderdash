# Boulderdash

##### This is game I developed during a programming course using Allegro 5. It was developed in C in along 2 Weeks!!! I did it well, but not flawless, so I need to address some problems. Although it is runnable.

1. Download the content and place it in a folder.
2. Install requirements
  - GCC Compiler 9 or greater
  - Allegro 5: Run on terminal **sudo apt-get install liballegro5-dev** to install Allegro on your system.
  - Utilitary **make**
  
 3. Run the command: **make Makefile all**
 4. Run **./bdash** and enjoy it.
